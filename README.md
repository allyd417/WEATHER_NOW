# WEATHER_NOW

This weather app is a work in progress. It was quite challenging to make but I tried my best.
This was going to be a weather app that you could look up the current forecast in your city and even a 5 day 
future forecast. I plan on switching up some more of the code and making it completely functional.

USER STORY
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
